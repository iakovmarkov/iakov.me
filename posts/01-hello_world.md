First post about this website, blog and what I'm going to do with them.
---
Welcome to my website! It's my little piece of Internet. Not very pretty, but I'm not a fan of pretty things. If you want to read more about me check the [About](/about) page.

I intend this site to be a showcase of my web dev skills - it's [source code is available on GitHub][0]. Feel free to take a look at it, I think it's pretty neat. I've used my favorite stack, really - ReactJS and TypeScript. It's a bit rough around the edges and missing a few features - I've written them down in _another_ blog post here. I intend to work on the website a bit more, and maintain it in future, maybe even rewrite into the shiny new tech that will come my way in future. I guess the most precious asset would be my blog - and it's written in Markdown, which is pretty widely supported.

By the way, the background of the homepage is a picture of Žižkov by [Jaromír Kavan on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@jerrykavan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText). I swear, finding the fitting picture for my homepage was an aesthetic challenge.

I'm still not sure about the blog. Initially I wanted to write only about "professional" stuff, but I think that's mighty boring. Besides, I'm really passionate about lots of what I do professionally - programming, automation, FOSS - that I'd rather write about that in my own manner. I also want to post some bits and pieces from my personal diary - what I like, what I think. I don't care if anyone will actually read this - I'm doing this for myself. It would be fun to check this out when I'm older.

Which reminds me - I need to figure out how to keep this alive after I die.
