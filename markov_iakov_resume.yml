about: |
  Hello! I'm Iakov. I'm a software engineer. It's both a job and an occupation. I'm passionate about software, open-source technologies, and making computers __do stuff__.  

  I've spent most of my career working as a web developer in the B2B area. In the last few years, I've been focused on an agile leadership role, helping my engineering teams align with business goals.  

  I was born in Yekaterinburg, Russia. I moved to Czechia when I was 19, and I still live in Prague. Apart from tech, I love slow heavy metal and artsy video games.

experience:
- role: Cloud Software Architect
  company: Evocode
  from: 2020-10
  note: I've taken a new challenge as a software architect, building a cloud-native platform for the Scandinavian automotive industry. My main responsibility was to kickstart a greenfield application development, build a robust cloud infrastructure and architecture, and to document it all.
  highlights:
  - Established and overseen cloud-native application development practices in a distributed, fully remote team. 
  - Facilitated cooperation between multiple organisations working on delivering one integrated product, leveraging Microsoft Azure infrastructure and services.
  - Implemented a DevOps infrastructure to ensure a seamless CI process across different teams. 

- role: Cloud Services Product Owner
  company: Ataccama
  from: 2019-03
  to: 2020-10
  note: I moved to become a PO and direct manager of a team of 5 people. My primary goal was to improve the Ataccama Platform-as-a-Service and the general Cloud platform capabilities of our software.
  highlights:
  - Directly managed a team of 5 Systems Engineers. I facilitated a SCRUM-like workflow, driven cooperation with Support and the Professional Services team, and created a long-term vision for the company's cloud competence.
  - Ensured smooth sailing of 6 PaaS customers. Implemented an on-call duty structure, as well as a team workflow, enabling quick reaction to both customer and colleague requests.
  - Driven adoption of Kubernetes and Docker. Those tools allow Ataccama to reduce the complex overhead of manual installation, thus speeding up deployment and maintenance.
  - Contributed to cloud-native deployment options of Ataccama tools. I created AWS and Azure automated deployment options and participated in delivering Kubernetes-based deployment to customers.

- role: Front-end Team Lead
  company: Ataccama
  from: 2017-03
  to: 2019-03
  note: I've risen to the opportunity to become the leader of the Front-end team. I've been in charge of growing the front-end team, as well as maintaining a consistent technical vision.
  highlights:
  - Encouraged cooperation on codebase across separate product teams. This allowed us to reuse a lot of component code and improve UI consistency. Some components were reused in a GWT (Java) codebase later.
  - Driven the adoption of modern front-end stack. The main accomplishment was a complete migration to TypeScript. TypeScript improved the developer experience dramatically. We also made use of TSLint, Prettier and Jest to improve the quality of our code.
  - Implemented a CI/CD pipeline for Ataccama ONE. This pipeline allowed multiple development teams to simultaneously deploy their code for testing and acceptance and sped up our iteration over product.
  - Attracted skilled talent for the company. Speaking on meetups or mentoring newbies in code boot camp helped me grow the front-end team from 3 to 10 skilled engineers in two years.

- role: Front-end Engineer
  company: Ataccama
  from: 2016-09
  to: 2017-03
  note: I was hired as one of the first internal front-end developers. I've worked on knowledge transfer and handover of the prototype from external consultants to Ataccama employees.
  highlights:
  - Encouraged active knowledge transfer from the team of external developers to Ataccama employees. This allowed us to develop the product using a lot of original codebase well into 2020.
  - Mentored less experienced colleagues. React and SPAs were new technologies for the company, so I got to share my experience with my peers.

- role: JavaScript Developer
  company: European Experts
  from: 2015-06
  to: 2016-09
  note: I was the primary JavaScript/front-end developer working on a new Applicant Tracking System in React and supporting a legacy mobile data collection app in Backbone.
  highlights:
  - Worked in a cross-functional agile team to quickly bring a prototype application to life. Ensured a handover of code and documentation to a new team that grew the prototype into a production app.
  - Built a single-page application using React, Reflux, and React-Router. Modern front-end stack allowed us to implement complex workflows and dynamic UI.
  - Added minor features and patched bugs in a massive Backbone codebase. This helped our users - NGOs and non-profits - carry on with their work in less fortunate parts of the world.

- role: Web Developer
  company: Fairpeople
  from: 2014-10
  to: 2015-12
  note: I have worked on a project offering website development to small businesses in Eastern Europe. I used WordPress extensively, developing a custom theme for it, and integrating it with other tools.
  highlights:
  - Worked alongside a web designer to implement a custom WordPress-based website. Implemented a responsive theme according to Sketch templates and a PHP plugin for order processing.
  - Built multiple demo websites using commercially-available themes. Those demo websites were shown to prospects to help them pick the design and features for their website.

- role: Freelance Developer
  from: 2013
  to: 2017
  note: I spent a lot of time working on smaller web dev jobs. An occasional website for a friend of a friend.
  highlights:
  - Learned the basics of lots of non-development skills. Learning how to manage my time and simple project management was invaluable in my professional career later.
  - Worked with lots of various technologies. I've learned how to manage DNS and Linux servers and worked on applications written in PHP, JavaScript, and Python.
