It's my little piece of Internet. Not very pretty, but I'm not a fan of pretty things. If you want to read more about me check the [About](/about) page.\r\n\r\nI intend this site to be a showcase of my web dev skills - it's [source code is available on GitHub][0]. Feel free to take a look at it, I think it's pretty neat. I've used my favorite stack, really - ReactJS and TypeScript. It's a bit rough around the edges and missing a few minor features. I intend to work on the website a bit more and maintain it, maybe even rewrite into the shiny new tech that will come my way in future. I guess the most precious asset would be my blog - and it's written in Markdown, which is pretty widely supported.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the background of the homepage is a picture of Žižkov by [Jaromír Kavan on Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@jerrykavan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText). I swear, finding the fitting picture for my homepage was an aesthetic challenge.\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure about the blog. I will write mostly about software engineering. Not necessarily only professional stuff, but also about things I do for fun. I will also move all my previous blog posts here.\r\n\r\nI consider the website to be mostly done. I am still missing some pieces here and there - mainly in the blog navigation. I'll add them once there is enough content so you actually need pagination and tag search. \r\n\r\n[0]: https://github.com/iakovmarkov/iakov.me"},"__N_SSG":true}
