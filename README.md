# iakov.me

Code for my personal webiste, [iakov.me](https://iakov.me/)

## FIXME

[ ] `Post/Image.tsx` contains a silly html injection from the blog posts, because I'm too lazy to re-type the credits from Unsplash every time I copy the picture. This might lead to XSS! So cool.
[ ] Excerpt is still being shown when deployed on Zeit, wtf?
